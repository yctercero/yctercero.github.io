Day one of HackReactor is hours away. The next three months will be intense and I look forward to the knowledge dump that is about to start. In an effort to quell my nerves (and appease the hypochondriac in me) after numerous google searches and WEB MD lookups, I'm officially diagnosing myself with imposter syndrome. To fellow classmates/future HackReactor-ers, the upside here is that we imposter syndrome sufferers are far from alone...though the downside is that the most common cause is being human.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
